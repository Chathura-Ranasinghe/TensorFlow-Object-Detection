# Fixing ImportError in Google Protobuf

If you encounter an `ImportError` related to the inability to import `builder` from `google.protobuf.internal`, follow these steps to resolve it:

## Steps:

1. **Upgrade Protobuf:**
   - Install the latest version of Protobuf using pip:
     ```
     pip install --upgrade protobuf
     ```

2. **Copy builder.py:**
   - Locate the `builder.py` file in your Protobuf installation directory (usually located at `.../Lib/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal`).
   - Copy the `builder.py` file to a safe location on your computer, for example, a folder named 'Documents'.

3. **Install Compatible Protobuf Version:**
   - Install a Protobuf version that is compatible with your project. For example, version 3.19.4:
     ```
     pip install protobuf==3.19.4
     ```

4. **Replace builder.py:**
   - Copy the `builder.py` file from the location where you saved it (e.g., 'Documents') to the `internal` folder of your Protobuf installation (`.../Lib/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal`).

5. **Run Your Code:**
   - After completing the above steps, run your code again to ensure that the issue has been resolved.

## Notes:
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to copy files into the Protobuf installation directory.
- Make sure to replace 'Documents' with the actual path where you saved the `builder.py` file.
- Verify compatibility between the Protobuf version you're installing and your project's requirements.
